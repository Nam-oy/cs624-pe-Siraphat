#Input
This application does not get user input. Instead, this App uses hardcoded data in source code that uses Text components. When the application starts, it serves as static content to be displayed to the user.

#Process
When the application starts, the App is loaded by the index.tsx entry file. Inside index.tsx, a View component wraps three Text components containing predefined text. A StyleSheet defines styling rules, including a yellow background color and text formatting. The StyleSheet is then applied to both the View and Text elements.

#Output
The application shows one view with three lines of text. These lines appear centered on the screen with a yellow background. This output will show after launch and will remain unchanged during the session.
